# Google Meet Presence List Extension

The Google Meet Presence List Extension was developed with the aim of assisting teachers during the pandemic when conducting online classes on Google Meet. Many teachers faced challenges in efficiently managing attendance during virtual sessions, leading to a significant amount of time being consumed in taking attendance manually for each class.

## Context

During the pandemic, the sudden shift to online education posed new challenges for educators. Conducting virtual classes on platforms like Google Meet required teachers to keep track of student attendance in real-time. However, the process of manually recording attendance for each session was time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to valuable teaching time being lost.

## Project Objective

To address this issue and streamline attendance tracking, the Google Meet Presence List Extension was created. The extension provides teachers with a simple and user-friendly solution to automatically generate an attendance list for each Google Meet session. By clicking the extension's button during the meeting, teachers can export a list of all the participants who were present, eliminating the need for manual attendance taking and saving precious time in every class.

## Features

- Supports multiple export formats:
  - CSV (EXCEL)
  - JSON
  - TXT

## Exportable Columns

- Name
- Entry Time
- Call Duration
- Last Attendance
